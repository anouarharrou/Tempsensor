# Temperature Monitoring using ESP8266 & OneWire
I was inspired to create a temperature sensor that I can monitor over wifi. The basic idea will allow me to check up on the temperature
at home while I was at work. 

I will Recieve an Email ALERTS if
temperature is not normal(over 34°C or Below -22°C).
